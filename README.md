Hi there!

Thanks for trying our game Endless Forms Most Pokittoful, or EFMP for short.

This game is based on Dave Hughes' original game called EFMB. This game can be found here: http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseekid.cgi?id=0027297

Our version takes graphical inspiration from the PC version done by Locomalito that can be found here: https://www.rgcd.co.uk/2012/07/endless-forms-most-beautiful-pc-2012.html

Due to the Pokitto's hardware limitations, storage limitations and memory limitations, and the fact it was coded in MicroPython which in itself has its own overheads, this version is quite a cut down version.

For example, this version misses out on: 2 enemy types, the moving worm, platform explosions, some item drop types like the weights, speed and shield. Other than that thought, each level is randomly generated (apart from the first 5 levels). The same counts for the enemies being randomly generated after level 5.

D-Pad: moves Moby left/right, up/down.
A: Starts game
B: Shows instructions
c: Ends the game

If at any time the game appears to lock up/freeze, this is due to the aforementioned memory limitations and Python overhead. Please turn your Pokitto off and on again and it should be fine once more. I've tried to reduce this from happening but not sure if it's been completely eliminated.

Hope you enjoy the game!

This game was completed during the month of September 2019.
